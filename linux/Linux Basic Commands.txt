Permissions: 
Entities => user, group, other/everyone else
Normal permission numbers => 4 = read(r), 2 = write(w), 1 = execute(x), 0 = none
Special permission numbers => 4 = set user ID on execute(UID), 2 = set group ID on execute(GID), 1 = set sticky bit/mode (t), 0 = none

$ sudo chmod 7777 file/folder (-R for recursive/Sub directories)
Here,
First 7 for set user, set group & sticky bit
Second 7 for User
Third 7 for Group
Fourth 7 for Other

Alphabetically Set Permissions:
$ chmod u+rwx file/folder (user's read, write and execute permission)
$ chmod g+rwx file/folder (groups's read, write and execute permission)

$ chmod u-w (remove write from user)
$ chmod g+wx (add write and execute to group)
$ chmod o+rwx (add read, write, and execute to other)
$ chmod u+s (add setuid)
$ chmod g+s (add setgid)
$ chmod o-t (remove sticky bit)
$ chmod a+rw => add read and write to all (u, g and o)
$ chmod a-x => remove execute from all (u, g and o)
$ chmod u=rwx, go=r => set read, write & execute on user and read, wirte on group & other
