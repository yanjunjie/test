Create a .htaccess, add the following lines and put the file in your root folder. I see that you've got it working but you're not supposed to have the */public at the end.

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/$1 [L]
</ifModule>
Try it, I got my Laravel application working with this.
