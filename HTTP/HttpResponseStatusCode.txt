//**********************List of HTTP status codes************************

This is a list of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) response status codes. Status codes are issued by a server in response to a client's request made to the server. It includes codes from IETF Request for Comments (RFCs). The status code is part of the HTTP/1.1 standard (RFC 7231).

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains the official registry of HTTP status codes.

All HTTP response status codes are separated into five classes or categories. The first digit of the status code defines the class of response, while the last two digits do not have any classifying or categorization role.

1xx informational response – the request was received, continuing process
2xx successful – the request was successfully received, understood and accepted
3xx redirection – further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
4xx client error – the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
5xx server error – the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request
