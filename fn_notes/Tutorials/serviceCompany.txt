Actually I have a ticket like `Publish W9 WO from Project`
ok. so w9 means a marketplace work orderl.
w9 is a tax term
we call a independent provider as w9 provider and the marketplace provider as a w9 work order
Service company should not be able to publish any marketplace work order
they can only see the w9 work order and can request those work order on behalf of their managed providers
