Method 01:

From a container ID (using docker ps -a), commit it to a new image name:

docker commit c16378f943fe registryhost/bablukpik/new_image_name:tag

And then login:

docker login

Finally, push it to a registry:

docker push registryhost/bablukpik/new_image_name:tag



Method 02:

From a source image to target (own) image. Hence, first tag the image with the host name or IP address, and the port of the registry and then username and then imagename:version/tag

docker tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]
docker image tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]
docker tag [OPTIONS] IMAGE[:TAG] [REGISTRYHOST/][USERNAME/]NAME[:TAG]

For Example:

docker image tag image_name hub.docker.com/bablukpik/image_name
docker tag rhel-httpd registry-host:5000/myadmin/rhel-httpd
docker tag rhel-httpd registry-host:5000/myadmin/rhel-httpd-abc:1.0


Then push the image to the registry using the same tag.

docker push NAME[:TAG]
bablukpik/image_name
registry-host:5000/myadmin/rhel-httpd-abc:1.0

N.B: Here, hub.docker.com is default so we can ommit it
