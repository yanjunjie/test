To setup the env for default host in windows. There are three ways 


1. To set the env for power sheel, git bash, and cmd by starting/restarting already created a default machine by Docker:

docker-machine start default
docker-machine restart default

Now check docker-machine env

2. The following environment properties need to be set:

set DOCKER_CERT_PATH=%USERPROFILE%\.docker\machine\machines\default
set DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.99.100:2376
set DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME=default
set DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1


3. To create a new machine using the following command:

Windows 10/HyperV:
docker-machine create --driver hyperv default
docker-machine create -d hyperv default

Mac, Linux, windows 7 & 8:
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default
docker-machine create -d virtualbox default




Rename Port Number:

docker run -d -p 80:80 --rm --name webserver nginx

If you want to force stop, remove, and recreate container, use the --rm flag



Rename container name:

docker rename 345df9ed5b47 new_name



To clean up any resources — images, containers, volumes, and networks — that are dangling (not associated with a container):

docker system prune


To additionally remove any stopped containers and all unused images (not just dangling images), add the -a flag to the command:

docker system prune -a


To delete all containers including its volumes use:

docker rm -vf $(docker ps -a -q)

-v: Remove all associated volumes
-f: Forces the removal


To delete all the images:

docker rmi -f $(docker images -a -q)
docker images purge

-a: for all containers, even not running
-q: to remove all the details other than the ID of containers

Remember, you should remove all the containers before removing all the images from which those containers were created.
